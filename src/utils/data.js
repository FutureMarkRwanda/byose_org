HIRWA Rukundo Hope is the Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of BYOSE, a technology startup committed to advancing robotics and embedded systems innovation in Africa. He leads BYOSE’s overall strategy, shaping its mission to develop intelligent automation, AI-powered robotics, and digital education solutions that empower people to build their own solutions everywhere.

Driven by a passion for **Robotics and Embedded Systems**, Hope founded BYOSE to serve as both a research-driven innovation hub and a community platform for young tech enthusiasts. Under his leadership, BYOSE has introduced several flagship projects, including:

* **BYOSE Academy([B-Academy](https://academy.byose.info/))** An online platform specializing in computer science and robotics education, with tools for class management, self-evaluation, and interactive robotics training.
* **[Foreach Academy](http://foreach.byose.info/)** A complementary e-learning platform born from increasing demand for flexible and engaging online education.
* **[PresenceEye](https://www.byose.info/presence-eye)** An AI-powered smart plug extension board for smart home automation and energy conservation, supported by companion apps ([*Presence-Eye*](https://www.byose.info/presence-eye/presents) and [*Charge-My-Device*](https://www.byose.info/presence-eye/presents?slideIndex=4&stepIndex=0)) on Android, Windows, and Linux.
* **[B-Bot](https://www.byose.info/presence-eye/presents?slideIndex=5&stepIndex=0)**  A locally-developed smart assistant robot with Alexa-like capabilities, designed for voice interaction and task automation .

Hope’s commitment to **Robotics and Embedded Systems** extends beyond BYOSE. He was invited as a mentor at WithinTech, where he guides aspiring innovators in robotics, IoT, and LEGO-based engineering. His personal research explores integrating smartphones into embedded systems as high-accuracy sensors for advanced applications.

In addition to his startup work, Hope has led multiple community and academic initiatives: he completed the **[iLead leadership program](https://ilead-rw.vercel.app/)** by Maxwell, earned recognition in **PicoCTF** competitions, and served as Vice-Chairman of his school’s committee. At Rwanda Coding Academy, he led the Robotics Club’s operations and drove multiple embedded systems projects, including **[Cryptavita](http://www.cryptavita.life/)**, an early warning system for natural hazards.

Hope’s educational journey spans from nursery school to high school, where he specialized in Software Programming and Embedded Systems at **Rwanda Coding Academy**. He plans to continue his studies abroad, with a focus on robotics, AI, and embedded systems innovation.
